# Building a REST API with Spring Boot

In [Spring Office Hours episode 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUj0hw50R9k) 
I saw that there is a [spring.academy](https://spring.academy/), so I had to check it out ;)

In detail, this repo is a following along of the course [Building a REST API with Spring Boot](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot).

In is a nice TDDish approach, but oh boy don't use this in-browser-editor, because it sucks.

Use Intellij, sorry but this is the only real IDE when it comes to Java / Kotlin and Spring.
